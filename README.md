# solution_limits
Python code for calculating the limits on ordered endmembers in PerpleX format.

To run the program, type:
<br>
`python calculate_limits.py <filename>`
<br>
where `<filename>` is the path to a file containing the endmember information (site names, multiplicities and occupancies).

Several examples of correctly-formatted files are provided in the examples directory.
